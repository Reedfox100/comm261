			The site is currently under construction, but here you will soon be able to look at any of the information you need for character creation!
			This will start you off in the right direction for getting your D&D session off to a perfect position to have as much fun (and sometimes stress) as possible.
			Stay tuned for the site update with the available information. Until then, please enjoy these cute pictures of animals in armor!
