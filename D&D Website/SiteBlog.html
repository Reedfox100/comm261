Entry 1<br />
<span style="padding-left: 50px">Hello everyone! This being my first post, I will be explaining the current plan with this blog, as well as why you should stick around to enjoy it through its entirety. 
	Back in June of this year, to entertain myself through lockdown I created an Ecosphere. If you don’t know what that is, it is a replica of a local ecosystem in a smaller environment like jar or bowl. 
	You do your best not to affect the environment further than what would naturally occur to it through the seasons because as most people know, especially Ian Malcolm, “Life finds a way.” 
	Even if most things die out in it or grow too large, it will always balance itself out. If it dies, it dies. The whole point of having such a thing to study and enjoy is that you can’t control it and you don’t need to. 
	Worrying about it won’t help and if you try to change it or help it, it is no longer a replica of the original environment. It is nature working in its most pure form. I made my ecosphere from the Mississippi up by Anoka, Minnesota. 
	Due to it being not far from the beginning of the river, there won’t be as many toxins in my system but there also won’t be a larger amount of microbial fauna or flora.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 50px">My current system contains plenty of silt at the base covered by some gravel and larger rocks. I have planted some Vallisneria americana (Water Celery or eelgrass). 
	The water put in it, like everything else, is directly from the river. Since June I have had plenty of Physa gyrina (Common Freshwater Snail) wandering around my jar as well as some Daphnia (Water Fleas) and some sort of worm that filter feeds by sticking out of the sand. 
	I cannot identify it because by the time I am writing this I cannot find any more of them. The grass has been growing perfectly so far and may start to grow too large. 
	I can’t touch it or groom it because that would be altering the environment but I hope it doesn’t grow so big that it suffocates any life other than it.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 50px">More posts to follow with updates on its condition. I'll talk to you all later!

Entry 2<br />
<span style="padding-left: 50px">Hello again everyone! This is my first update on my ecosphere, and currently it is going interestingly. Currently, the jar is much darker since I cannot give it as much sunlight or warmth. 
	The plants have slowly been dying off a little as a direct response to the lack of sun and heat. There aren’t as many snails now either, the last of them are either very small or are kept in smaller pockets underneath the soil. 
	I would assume that with better temperatures they would return quite quickly. I cannot seem to find any more of the worm-like things poking out of the soil so I can assume the same fate as the snails have faced them. 
	There is also some Duckweed (Lemna Minor) at the surface of the jar I forgot to mention in my last post. It isn't doing the worst but I wonder if the jar itself will survive the winter. 
	The cold is natural for the Mississippi but it is a river that is used to some form of movement. Who knows what could happen! I don’t have photos currently of the jar itself since it really just doesn’t look any different than you would imagine. 
	It is just a mason jar that is mostly black on the inside now with small wisps of vegetation left over.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 50px">My current plan is to let it sit and see if I can revive it with the natural lighting. If the jar ends up not coming back or dying out completely, that's alright. It is natural for something like that to happen! 
	Next summer I can always just restart and make a new jar, using my knowledge from this year to maybe open it and let it breathe every once in a while. I could also end up needing to add a UV light for the plants in it. 
	Winter in Minnesota/North Dakota is not kind of any sort of plant, including the ones that don’t get frozen to death.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 50px">If you have any ideas or questions don’t hesitate to ask! My email is below on the bottom of the website this blog is on. Also for anyone who found it weird that the blog for an ecosphere was on a D&D website, it’s because both are mine and I wanted to be able to connect the two in some way. 
	Both are passions of mine that I have really come to enjoy and take time in. Why not take pleasure in both at the same time? That's all for now. Talk to you soon!
